| Dec 2  | 8:55 - 9:25 | I brainstormed solutions, like maybe using a code for most used words that uses less space. I also thought of replacing each word with a number, perhaps how frequently it occurs. I still wasn't completely sure if this was the right approach, though. |
| Dec 2  | 9:25 - 9:55 |                                                                                               I continued brainstorming. I implemented a header with a dictionary for words in the file and a code assigned to them. I was thinking of using a hashtable. |
| Dec 3  | 1:55 - 2:25 |                                                                                                                                 The header was becoming too large. The file was not compressing. I debated whether or not to use hashcode with the words. |
| Dec 3  | 2:25 - 2:55 |                   I implemented adding new words to a new hashtable dictionary. Any repeated word would use the index of the word in the dictionary. I used start code to map the pattern when code words were used instead of the actual repeated words. |
| Dec 3  | 6:00 - 6:30 |                                                                                                                                    I created a string for punctuation. I wanted to use it as is. I wrote code to separate out words between punctuations. |
| Dec 3  | 6:30 - 7:00 |                                I realized I needed to add punctuations to the dictionary code as well. I wrote compress and expand code.  I tested with the Alice file. The code was compressing, but the expansion has errors and the file is different. |
| Dec 9  |  5 - 5:30   |                                               I reviewed the TST. java. Initially, I was puzzled as to why there was no look up function for inputting code as a parameter to get a return value of a corresponding string. I wrote the compression code. |
| Dec 9  |  5:30 - 6   |                                                                                    I wrote the expansion code. I debated on the size of the compressed bits to use for one character. I used the entire askii table as dictionary and 256 as end of file. |
| Dec 10 |  8:30 - 9   |                                                                                                                                                          I tested the code. I then debugged the code. The shakespeare file was initially taking too long. |
| Dec 10 |  9 - 9:30   |        I realized to break from the outer while loop after hitting end of file. I removed the lookup function with code as parameter and that returned corresponding string. I did this because it was an unnecessary idea of mine. All the tests passed. |
